A wild traverse of a fun ridge leading to a less frequented peak.

<!--more-->

I was looking for a mountain to climb while we were in Reefton and Mount Blackadder had a certain ring to it. There was scant information online about it, but it looked feasible.

There is a good trail which takes you above the treeline and from there the ridge is the real star. It just keeps on giving and gets a bit hairy in places, but there's always a way forward.

The views were incredible and the area can keep you busy for a very long time.

Unfortunately, there was no sign of Baldrick in the vicinity.
