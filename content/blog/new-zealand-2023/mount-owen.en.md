A spectacular adventure into Lord of the Rings territory with Thomas.

<!--more-->

Mount Owen is the setting for some of the Mines of Moria scenes in Lord of the Rings. It is a spectacular place and is home to incredible rock formations and deep caverns. The hut is in a wonderful setting and the area around it is ripe for further exploration.

We climbed Mount Owen in the morning just before the cloud drifted in.
