A party of five headed into the less frequented area of the Hex lying just to the east of Milner Peak.

We hiked in from Eselfontein, following a good trail for 4km up the mountain (albeit with a brief bushwack to get into the swing of things). Then it was off piste as we chose a more or less direct line to our chosen campsite. This was located some 300m below Moraine Corner, next to a nice stream with a few dipping pools.

We spent the afternoon admiring the views from down into Moraine kloof as we summited Moraine Corner and Plateau Point.

On Sunday we climbed Boskloofpiek and Eselberg. Both of these peaks are interesting in their own right, with numerous rock formations to play on and gorgeous views. Both also have some lovely vlaktes, with those on Boskloofpiek stretching on for kilometres.

After five hours spent exploring these peaks, it was time to head down. We decided to see where the kloof we were camped led us and this proved to be a fantastic decision. It is a lovely kloof with big pools, some waterfalls, and relatively easy walking. Eventually, we had to traverse out and find our trail again. This was accomplished without too much fuss, although the early summer sun did make its presence felt. We reached the cars in the late afternoon having forged new friendships and great memories.
